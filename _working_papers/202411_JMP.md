title: "Bank Loan Reliance and Inflation Inattention"
excerpt: 'Utilizing merged Italian firm-level data, we provide causal evidence that firms heavily reliant on bank loans are better informed about inflation and make smaller forecast errors. We also show that financing composition affects how firms learn from new information with randomized control trials. To explain these findings, we develop a general equilibrium model featuring rational inattention where firms become more attentive when their financing costs are sensitive to aggregate inflation. Inflation impacts the relative cost of external versus internal funding, leading firms to adjust their investment, capital structure, and attention allocation. The heterogeneous financing compositions among firms generate dispersion in inflation expectations. Our model replicates the empirical evidence and offers interesting policy implications.'
