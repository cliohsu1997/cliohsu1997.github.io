title: "Scarring Effects of Macroeconomic Conditions on New Firms"
excerpt: "This project explores the persistent effects of economic conditions when businesses enter into the market on the financing composition over the lifecycle. Since infant businesses' behaviors have sizable aggregate implications in job creation and investment, it is important to understand how the starting conditions affect new firms' ability to obtain financing and their long-run growth potential. Using firm-level data from Orbis and employing the local projection method, I provide new evidence that firms undergo credit contractions in their initial three years, start with a lower debt-to-equity ratio, and maintain this low leverage for the following six years. Additionally, these infant businesses have a larger share of tangible fixed assets, exhibit lower labor productivity, and have a lower investment ratio compared to their older counterparts. I further show that this persistence is linked to financial constraint: infant firms operating in sectors with high external financial dependence exhibit persistent differences in their balance sheet characteristics, productivity, and investment patterns. The empirical findings suggest a story with credit reputation accumulation. Due to imperfect information, a firm's quality is gradually revealed through interactions with financial institutions. Firms born during credit tightening start with low leverage ratios, which hampered their ability to attain external funding in the future due to the slow buildup of their credit reputation. In contrast, older firms whose quality is already better known by the financial market face less persistent impacts from the tighter credit conditions. Meanwhile, the aggregate economic conditions encourage the formation of low-leverage businesses, leading to a compositional effect."
